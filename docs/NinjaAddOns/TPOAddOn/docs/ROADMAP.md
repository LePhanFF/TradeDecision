## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Stabilization

- [x] UpdateHeader uses `menuItem.Dispatcher` with shutdown guards.
- [x] UiHostWindow updates only on its Dispatcher.
- [x] SafeOut hardened.
- [x] Instrument resolution from `instruments.txt` (defaults: ES/NQ/YM front-month).
- [x] UI dark theme (background #1E1E1E, text #E0E0E0).
- [x] Fonts standardized (Segoe UI, Consolas in textboxes).
- [x] Professional accent colors (green/red/amber/orange).
- [x] Commentary/evidence styled for readability.
- [x] dPOC trail rendering (DeepSkyBlue stroke).
- [x] Postmortem + runtime notes documented.
- [x] Prompt guardrails (`PROMPT_CODEGEN_NT8` + `AddOn v2.3`).
- [x] Repo tools: `nt8_linter`, `nt8_autofix`, `nt8_postinstall_verify`.
- [x] Sample `instruments.txt` provided.
- [x] Optional git pre-commit hook.
