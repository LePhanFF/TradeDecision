Global Playbook (applies every day)

Bias framing

Compare POC vs prior POC (above/at/below).

Check POC migration (15m) → higher / lower / flat.

Note gap direction & closure (closure = potential order-flow flip).

Entries

Initiate at VAH/VAL or after BOS + acceptance (no mid-profile chases).

Use HVN/LVN ladder: trade from HVN to POC; LVN is “air pocket” for continuation.

Scaling & Targets

First scale at POC (magnet).

Second at VAL/VAH once accepted beyond edge.

Risk

10:30 Gate: no counter-trend risk into impulse pre-10:30 without clean rejection + acceptance.

Short confirmations: need (rejection at VAH/gap) AND (POC shift down OR VWAP rejection).

If any index closes its RTH gap, reassess bias; watch SMT vs ONH/ONL and value edges.

Day-Type Playbooks

D (Balanced)

Work rotations between VAL ↔ POC ↔ VAH.

Fresh trades only at edges or post-BOS acceptance.

Expect mean-revert to POC if acceptance fails.

P (Short-Covering)

Want POC migrating up, IB high extension, narrow/moderate VA.

Join on pullbacks to VAH/POC after acceptance.

Invalidate if gap closes and POC rolls down.

b (Long-Liquidation)

Mirror of P: POC down, IB low extension, narrow/moderate VA.

Join on pullbacks to VAL/POC after acceptance.

Invalidate if gap closes and POC rolls up.

B (Double Distribution)

Trade node-to-node: from upper HVN to LVN to lower HVN (or reverse).

The LVN between distributions is your decision line (accept vs reject).

Break/accept above upper distribution → continuation; fail → rotate back to mid/POC.

Opening-Type Playbook (Dalton)

OIR (in prior value): fade early extremes back to POC/value until BOS.

OOR (outside value): look for test → accept/reject at prior VAH/VAL/POC; drive possible.

OD (drive): join in direction at first pullback to ref; avoid fading.

OTD (test-drive): initial test of ref, then drive — trade with drive post-acceptance.

ORR (rejection-reverse): fade through open/IB after clear rejection at ref.

POC Migration Playbook

Higher: favor long rotations/continuations if above prior POC and not negated by gap-closure.

Lower: favor short rotations/continuations if below prior POC and not negated by gap-closure.

Flat: treat as balance; lean on HVN/POC magnets and VA edges.

Gap Playbook

Open UP/DOWN: trade with gap only after acceptance; first test often fades toward prior close.

Gap Closed = True: increase odds of mean reversion / flip; downgrade trend labels unless POC slope agrees.

Time-of-Day Playbook

09:30–10:30 (IB): define opening type; use gap logic; first tests at prior VA/POC/gap are key.

10:30–12:00: continuation only with acceptance + POC support; otherwise rotations.

12:00–13:30: lunch balance; fade only at VAH/VAL/HVN/LVN (tight risk).

13:30–15:30: watch late breakout from value or revert to POC if acceptance fails.

Alerts we track (action cues)

gap_closed(<sym>) → reassess bias.

poc_shift_up/down(<sym>, <time>) → confirm/negate trend.

ib_break_H/L(<sym>, <time>) → validate trend potential.

vah_val_reject(<sym>, <level>, <time>) → fade setup.

bimodality_detected(<sym>) → switch to B-day node-to-node plan.
