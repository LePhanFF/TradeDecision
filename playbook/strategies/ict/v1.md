### üîë Core Setups & Concepts

1. **ONH / ONL Sweeps**

   * Watch for liquidity grabs above **Overnight High (ONH)** or below **Overnight Low (ONL)**.
   * Expect a **reversal back into range** if the sweep is rejected.
   * Confluence: VWAP, PDH/PDL, daily gap levels, breaker/FVG.

2. **SMT Divergence**

   * Compare ES / NQ / YM indices.
   * If one index makes a **higher high** but another fails (or vice versa), that‚Äôs a divergence ‚Üí signals exhaustion.
   * Stronger when divergence happens at key levels (ONH/ONL, PDH/PDL, gap edges).

3. **Breaker Blocks**

   * Bullish breaker: prior swing **low** that failed ‚Üí price rallies back above and holds.
   * Bearish breaker: prior swing **high** that failed ‚Üí price sells back below and holds.
   * Use as **entry zones** with clear invalidation.

4. **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)**

   * Measure inefficiency: 3-candle gap where middle candle‚Äôs body doesn‚Äôt overlap.
   * Target ‚Üí expect partial fill or full fill.
   * High probability when aligned with ONH/ONL sweeps or breaker retests.

5. **Unicorn Setups**

   * Multiple ICT confluences line up:

     * Liquidity sweep (ONH/ONL/PDH/PDL).
     * SMT divergence.
     * Breaker block acceptance.
     * FVG alignment.
   * Trade with **higher conviction + larger risk allocation** (subject to repair rules).

### ‚è∞ Time-of-Day Framework

* **09:30‚Äì10:30 (Killzone):**

  * Most reliable reversals or breakout continuations.
  * No counter-trend risk before 10:30 unless clear rejection (your Dalton 10:30 gate rule matches this).
* **11:00‚Äì12:00 (Lunch Fade):**

  * Lower volume ‚Üí trap setups common. Prefer confirmed levels only.
* **14:00‚Äì15:30 (Afternoon Drive):**

  * Trend continuation or failed morning move.
  * Reassess gap closure, rolling POC, VWAP drift.

### üìä Evidence / Confirmation

* Location first (ONH/ONL, PDH/PDL, VAH/VAL).
* SMT divergence across indices.
* Breaker block or FVG alignment.
* Time-of-day filter.
* Execution checklist (bias ‚Üí entry trigger ‚Üí invalidate).

### ‚úÖ How to Trade It

1. **Identify bias** (gap, POC shift, value acceptance).
2. **Wait for liquidity event** (ONH/ONL sweep, PDH/PDL raid).
3. **Confirm divergence / breaker / FVG.**
4. **Enter with invalidation clearly defined.**
5. **Scale:** first target = POC, second = VAL/PDL once accepted.
6. **Risk rules:** repair mode, cooldowns, D-day limits still apply.
