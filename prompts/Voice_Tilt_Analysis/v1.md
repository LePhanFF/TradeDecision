# 🎙️ Voice Analysis Prompt – Tilt Detection

**Purpose:**
Process voice logs / transcripts of your reflections, trading commentary, or live journaling. Detect tilt, revenge trading, over-trading, FOMO, emotional bias, and deviations from your playbook/rules. Provide both *diagnosis* and *actionable nudges*.

## **Prompt Structure**

**Input:**

* Transcript (raw or cleaned).
* Optional metadata: timestamp, session (morning/afternoon/post-close), trading outcome (PnL, win/loss).

**Output Sections:**

1. **Emotional Tone Classification**

   * Calm / Neutral
   * Confident / Disciplined
   * Frustrated / Tilted
   * FOMO / Impulsive
   * Revenge-seeking
   * Burnout / Fatigue

2. **Tilt Detection Markers**

   * Over-trading language (“keep clicking,” “I can get it back”).
   * Revenge language (“I’ll make it back,” “I have to hit them back”).
   * FOMO language (“I don’t want to miss it,” “it’s running without me”).
   * Self-doubt / fatigue markers (“I’m tired,” “I can’t focus”).

3. **Playbook Alignment Check**

   * Compare to your **Dalton/ICT execution rules**:
     • Enter only at VAH/VAL or BOS+acceptance.
     • No counter-trend impulse risk pre-10:30 unless rejection confirmed.
     • 2 scratches → 20-min cooldown.
     • Shorts need VAH/gap rejection **and** POC shift down/VWAP rejection.
     • Repair mode = half size, max 2 sequences pre-noon.
   * Flag any violations (e.g., “entered mid-profile,” “added size after 2 scratches,” “no cooldown”).

4. **Behavioral Risk Score (0–100)**

   * 0–20 = fully disciplined
   * 21–40 = minor drift (watch)
   * 41–70 = moderate tilt (pause advised)
   * 71–100 = severe tilt (mandatory stop)

5. **Actionable Feedback / Nudge**

   * If calm/disciplined → reinforce good behavior.
   * If drift/tilt detected → recommend cooldown, smaller size, journaling, or walking away.
   * Always provide 1 concrete “do next” action.

## **Special Features**

* **Pattern Learning:** Track recurring tilt triggers (e.g., time-of-day, losing streak, external stress).
* **Energy & Focus:** Suggest if routine steps (coffee, stretching, break, swim, pickleball) are missing.
* **Logging:** Option to produce a structured CSV/JSON row: `{timestamp, tone, tilt_score, violations, nudge}` for journaling dashboards.
