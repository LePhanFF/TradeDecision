[ID] A-KC-001 (Easy)
Q: In Dalton's auction view, markets alternate primarily between which two modes?
A) Reversal and continuation
B) Price discovery and value discovery
C) Momentum and mean reversion
D) Breakout and breakdown
Correct: B) Price discovery and value discovery
Why: Auctions explore price to find new value, then build acceptance around it.
Evidence: [MiP — Auction basics and MGI, pp. 6-45]

[ID] A-KC-002 (Medium)
Q: Which observation most strongly indicates acceptance at a price area?
A) A single fast print through the level
B) Multiple 30-minute bars with overlapping value around that level
C) A gap that immediately fills
D) A thin profile with few TPOs
Correct: B) Multiple 30-minute bars with overlapping value around that level
Why: Time spent and overlapping value show the market agreeing on fairness.
Evidence: [MiP — Acceptance and value formation, pp. 70-92, 165-225]

[ID] A-KC-003 (Medium)
Q: Rejection at a high is most clearly evidenced by:
A) A flat, multi-TPO top with no tail
B) A prominent POC near the high
C) A tail of single prints that price does not revisit quickly
D) An open auction at the high
Correct: C) A tail of single prints that price does not revisit quickly
Why: Single-print tails are classic excess, signaling rejection.
Evidence: [MiP — Excess and rejection, pp. 103-157]

[ID] A-KC-004 (Medium)
Q: Initial Balance (IB) is important mainly because it:
A) Determines the next day's open type
B) Defines the first hour range that frames range extension signals
C) Sets the VWAP bands automatically
D) Guarantees a trend day
Correct: B) Defines the first hour range that frames range extension signals
Why: Range extension beyond IB reveals participation by stronger timeframes.
