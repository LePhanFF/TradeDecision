# READMe Quiz (v9.4.3 + Markets in Profile)

## Section A — v9.4.3-Specific Quiz
(Instructions for the reader)
- All questions are multiple choice (4 options).
- One correct answer per question.
- Each item includes an explanation and a “MiP” evidence footnote.

### A.1 Key Concepts (5 concepts × 5 Qs each = 25 Qs)
- Select the 5 most central “key concepts” **from the v9.4.3 README**.
- For each concept, write 5 questions (mixed difficulty).
- Examples (only if present in the README): auctions & value discovery, acceptance vs rejection, IB & range extension, excess/poor highs-lows, HVN/LVN, day-types (P/b/D/B), open types, one-timeframing, context & trend vs bracket, fair value vs price.

### A.2 Metrics (1–3 Qs per metric)
- Identify every metric defined/used in v9.4.3 (e.g., VAH/POC/VAL, IB, RE, net change, rotation factor, single prints count, value shift, etc.).
- For **each** metric, produce 1–3 MCQs on definition, calculation, interpretation, or thresholds.

### A.3 Scoring (5–10 Qs)
- From the v9.4.3 scoring framework: produce 5–10 MCQs that test how the score is computed, weighted, thresholded, and interpreted for bias/conviction/context.

### A.4 Playbooks (2–5 Qs per playbook)
- Enumerate every playbook in v9.4.3 (e.g., “Go with breakout,” “Fade extreme,” “Inventory rebalance,” “Open-Drive continuation,” “Bracket edge fade,” etc., as defined in the README).
- For **each** playbook, write 2–5 MCQs that probe entry triggers, invalidation, risk placement, and management aligned with v9.4.3’s definitions.

## Answering/Formatting Rules (apply to every question)
- **ID**: `A-KC-001` (for Section A) or `B-xxx-###` (for Section B).
- **Difficulty**: `Easy | Medium | Hard`.
- **Stem**: crisp, non-leading; avoid “always/never.”
- **Choices**: A–D; four plausible options; **randomize order** per item.
- **Correct**: show letter + exact text of the right option.
- **Why**: a 1–3 line explanation anchoring to the concept, metric, or rule.
- **Evidence**: a footnote citing *Markets in Profile* — `[MiP — Chapter/Section, page #, brief supporting excerpt or paraphrase]`.

## Output Example (one item)
[ID] A-KC-001 (Medium)  
Q: Which statement best defines “value area” in Market Profile?  
A) The day’s highest traded price  
B) The range containing ~70% of TPOs around the POC  ← **CORRECT**  
C) The midpoint of the daily range only  
D) The first hour’s range  
Why: Value area is the 70% TPO region around the most accepted price (POC), used to distinguish price vs value in the day timeframe.  
Evidence: [MiP — “Market Profile Fundamentals”, Ch. 2, p. 23–26: value area is the ~70% TPO band; see figures & explanation.]

## Quality & Randomization
- Randomize choice order per item; vary position of the correct option.
- Avoid “All of the above / None of the above” unless clearly justified.
- Keep stems concise; explanations specific.
- Ensure distractors are common confusions (e.g., price vs value, IB vs full range, excess vs poor highs, momentum vs acceptance).
- Avoid copying long passages; quote briefly and paraphrase appropriately.

## Completion
- Produce the complete `readme-quiz.txt` content **in one block**.
- Do **not** include anything else (no YAML/JSON, no tables).
- Ensure at least:
  - **Section A:** 5 key concepts × 5 Qs (=25), plus metrics (1–3 each), scoring (5–10), and playbooks (2–5 each).  
  - **Section B:** **100** total MCQs across the book.
- Double-check that **every** question includes a MiP evidence footnote.
