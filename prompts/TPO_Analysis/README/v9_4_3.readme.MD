Primary theory: James Dalton, Markets in Profile (page ranges cited below).


1) Key Dalton Concepts (one paragraph each, with page ranges)
-------------------------------------------------------------
• Auction Theory (pp. 6–45)
  Markets are ongoing auctions balancing buyers and sellers. Price advertises opportunities, time regulates
  participation, and volume confirms interest. Read auction behavior, not just price. When the market can’t find
  new value, it rotates; when it does, it trends.

• Acceptance (pp. 70–92, 165–225)
  Acceptance occurs when the market spends TIME and/or VOLUME at prices, building Value Area and often shifting
  the POC. Acceptance signals the market is comfortable at those prices; that has trade implications (continuation).

• Rejection (pp. 103–157)
  Rejection is the opposite—price is quickly abandoned, leaving single-print tails (excess) or thin LVN bands.
  Rejected areas often act as edges to lean on for trades (fade back inside or break with acceptance).

• Time vs Price vs Volume (pp. 45–92)
  Dalton’s “full picture” comes from all three: price alone is a weak clue. TIME at price (TPO), raw price movement,
  and VOLUME distribution together reveal acceptance vs rejection and likely paths.

• Value Migration (pp. 70–92, 165–225)
  When today’s Value Area or POC shifts higher or lower versus yesterday, the auction is migrating value. Upward
  migration supports bullish bias; downward supports bearish bias; unchanged value supports balance.

• Market Generated Information (MGI) (pp. 6–45)
  MGI is what the market “says” through structure: IB size, RE, single prints, nodes, anomalies, spikes, etc.
  Treat MGI as first-class evidence rather than only price patterns.

• Initial Balance Importance (pp. 70–92)
  The first hour’s range (IB) is the day’s backbone. Range Extension (RE) tests initiative strength; failure to
  hold beyond IB supports balance plays.

• Excess (pp. 103–157)
  Long single-print tails at highs/lows mark the end of an auction. Lack of excess can mean “unfinished” structure
  and increased chances of revisits.

• Single Prints (pp. 45–92)
  Fast auction zones (1-TPO wide) indicate thin structure that often gets repaired later. These regions are common
  targets during rotations and traversals.

• Poor Highs / Poor Lows (pp. 103–157)
  Extremes printed without excess (multiple TPOs at the high/low or equal highs/lows). Markets often revisit them to
  complete the auction and create proper excess.

• One-Timeframing (pp. 199–225)
  Each 30-min bar makes higher lows (up) or lower highs (down). Do not fade one-timeframing until it breaks; it’s a
  strong sign of directional conviction.

• Day-Type Recognition (pp. 70–205)
  Profile resolves into known day types (Trend, Double Distribution, Normal, Normal-Variation, Neutral, Neutral-Extreme,
  Non-Trend/Balance). Each type implies who’s in control and reasonable expectations for continuation/rotation.

• Context (pp. 6–45, 165–225)
  Always judge short-term action within intermediate and long-term context. An intraday up-move inside a longer-term
  downtrend can have limited legs.

• Confidence (pp. 192–202)
  Market confidence appears as elongation, OTF persistence, and aligned volume. Low confidence looks like two-sided
  trade, fat POC, and lack of follow-through.

• Inventory (pp. 178–205)
  Positioning relative to value (too long/too short). Overstretched inventory tends to correct after the open—useful
  for gap-fade logic.


2) Metrics (v9.4.3 Superset) — for EACH metric include Definition, Why, How Computed, How Used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Opening Types (OD / OTD / ORR / OA) (pp. 192–202)
   • Definition: OD = drive; OTD = test then drive; ORR = tail then reverse; OA = two-sided rotation.
   • Why: Opening conviction sets expectations for day type and trend odds.
   • How: Classify using first 30–60m of RTH behavior; confirm with IB/RE and acceptance.
   • Use: Feeds opening playbooks; influences confidence and early bias.

B. Gap Module (pp. 70–92)
   • Definition: Classify the open vs prior value/range: Outside_Prior_Range, Into_Prior_Range, Within_Prior_Value.
   • Why: Out-of-balance opens can trend if accepted; returns inside often traverse the prior range.
   • How: Compute gap direction/size, Gap_Fill_%, time to first 50% fill, completion.
   • Use: Gap & Go vs Gap Fade; RTH Gap Close plays.

C. Overnight Inventory (pp. 178–205)
   • Definition: Positioning from the ON session—Too Long, Too Short, Balanced.
   • Why: Stretched ON inventory frequently corrects after RTH open.
   • How: Compare ON direction vs prior settle and ON value references.
   • Use: Adds context and bias to gap/fade expectations.

D. Initial Balance (IB) & Range Extension (RE) (pp. 70–92)
   • Definition: IB = first hour high/low; RE = first break outside the IB.
   • Why: RE with acceptance indicates initiative control; failed RE supports balance.
   • How: IB from first 60m; acceptance tiers = provisional (2×15m closes + TPO build) vs confirmed (≥1×30m + elongation).
   • Use: IB Breakout Success vs Failure → Balance playbooks.

E. Value Areas & POC (pp. 45–92, 165–225)
   • Definition: VAH/POC/VAL from TPO; Volume VA/POC if available. Compare value vs yesterday (Higher/Lower/Overlaps/Inside/Outside).
   • Why: Value is agreement. Value migration = bias; leaving value without acceptance = likely reversion.
   • How: Compute standard 70% TPO area and POC; compute volume distribution when available.
   • Use: Set bias and targets; define acceptance zones and mean-reversion locations.

F. Shapes (P, b, D) (pp. 178–205)
   • Definition: P = short covering (upper skew), b = long liquidation (lower skew), D = balance (fat center).
   • Why: Shapes hint at who’s in control (limited timeframe vs longer-term) and likely follow-through.
   • How: Tail lengths, center fatness, skew around POC; corroborate with dPOC behavior.
   • Use: Choose shape playbooks; watch morphs (P→B, b→B, D→P/b).

G. Excess & Poor High/Low (pp. 103–157)
   • Definition: Excess = tails marking end of auction; poor extremes = no excess (unfinished).
   • Why: Excess often starts reversals; poor extremes attract revisits.
   • How: Measure tail size; detect multiple TPOs/equal extremes.
   • Use: Carry forward as trade references/targets.

H. Spikes & Spike Base (pp. 103–157)
   • Definition: Late-day vertical move; “base” is last accepted area before spike.
   • Why: Next day above base = acceptance/continuation; below = rejection/fade.
   • How: Detect late expansion; mark base; check open/acceptance vs base next day.
   • Use: Next-day spike playbooks.

I. One-Timeframing (pp. 199–225)
   • Definition: Consecutive 30m bars make higher lows (up) or lower highs (down).
   • Why: Indicates strong conviction; do not fade until OTF breaks.
   • How: Compare successive period extremes.
   • Use: Guardrail for countertrend ideas across all plays.

J. Prominent POC (pp. 165–225)
   • Definition: POC row with unusually many TPOs (e.g., ≥1.5× median row).
   • Why: Acts like a magnet; momentum away can stall.
   • How: Count TPO per row; flag prominence.
   • Use: Reduce size when trading away; consider mean-reversion.

K. Revisit Magnets (pp. 45–92)
   • Definition: Single prints and fat loops (b/p) that often get “repaired.”
   • Why: Auctions tend to revisit anomalies and nodes.
   • How: Mark singles and fat loops from the profile.
   • Use: Targets during traversals and fades.

L. Developing POC (dPOC), 15m tracking (pp. 45–92)
   • Definition: Evolving POC during the session; track path every 15m.
   • Why: Stable dPOC = balance; persistent migration = value shift/trend development.
   • How: Record dpoc_path_15m, migration ticks/speed, stability ratio, jumps.
   • Use: Supports morph calls; enables relocation plays.

M. HVN/LVN Arrays (pp. 45–92)
   • Definition: HVN = fat node; LVN = thin node (local maxima/minima in TPO/volume histogram).
   • Why: Auctions rest at HVNs and skip LVNs; LVN breaks can travel fast.
   • How: Detect multiple nodes above/below current price with prominence and spacing.
   • Use: HVN/LVN playbooks (rejections, breaks, traversals).

N. RTH Gap Close (pp. 70–92)
   • Definition: Track when RTH gap fills back to prior RTH close.
   • Why: Balanced days often fill gaps; failure to fill shows conviction.
   • How: Record direction, size, time to close; note peer index closings.
   • Use: RTH Gap Close plays (fade toward close with acceptance).

O. Balance Box & LAB/LBF (pp. 70–92)
   • Definition: Recent balance range and tests of its edges (Look Above/Below & Fail).
   • Why: Failed probes often traverse the box to the opposite edge.
   • How: Derive top/bottom from swings and VA bands; detect failed probes.
   • Use: Mean-reversion LAB/LBF playbooks.

P. 15m Overlay (pp. 70–92)
   • Definition: Faster lens for early acceptance/rejection versus 30m structure.
   • Why: Lets you anticipate breakouts/failures sooner.
   • How: Check for 2×15m closes beyond IB extremes before 30m confirmation.
   • Use: Early entries with clear invalidations.

Q. Peer Gap Close (pp. 70–92)
   • Definition: Cross-index awareness (e.g., ES/NQ/YM) for gap fills.
   • Why: Peer gap closes can warn/confirm your instrument’s path.
   • How: Track peer gap-close status/time.
   • Use: Confidence adjustment in gap plays.


3) Day-Type Taxonomy (pp. 70–205) — Definition, Who’s in control, Why it matters, Trade Implications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Trend Day (Up/Down): Initiative control, strong elongation, OTF intact. Expect go-with trades; don’t fade until OTF breaks.
• Double-Distribution Trend Day: Morning trend, midday balance, afternoon trend continuation. Rejoin on break from midday balance.
• Normal Day: Large IB, minimal RE. Balanced auction; fade extremes back to POC.
• Normal-Variation Day: Large IB with one-sided extension. Go-with the extension if accepted; otherwise fade to POC.
• Neutral Day: RE both sides, mid close. Two-sided auction; fade edges unless late initiative emerges.
• Neutral-Extreme Day: RE both sides, close near an extreme; likely carry-over if accepted (watch spike rules).
• Non-Trend / Balance (D-Day): Narrow IB, fat center. Mean-reversion; LAB/LBF at edges.
• P-shape (short covering): Limited timeframe buying; continuation requires new value above.
• b-shape (long liquidation): Limited timeframe selling; continuation requires new value below.
• Morphs: P→B, b→B, D→P, D→b, Normal→Trend, Neutral→Extreme, Trend→DD. Morphs change plan; wait for acceptance.


4) Dynamic Confidence Scoring (0–100) — Definition, Why, Computation, Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Components and default points (tune by instrument):
• Opening Type (pp. 192–202): OD 30, OTD 22, ORR 18, OA 8 → Early conviction.
• RE Status (pp. 70–92): +20 confirmed, +12 provisional, −10 failure → Initiative vs balance.
• Value vs Yesterday (pp. 45–92): +12 Outside/Higher/Lower, +5/−5 Overlaps, 0 Inside → Bias tilt.
• Volume Alignment (pp. 45–92): +10 aligned, −5 misaligned → Confirmation of attempted direction.
• Day-Type Clarity (pp. 70–205): +12 Trend, +8 DD, +6 Normal/NV/Neutral/NE, +4 Balance → Certainty.
• One-Timeframing (pp. 199–225): +8 if intact → Don’t fade trend.
• 30m vs 15m Confluence (pp. 70–92): +8 agree, −8 disagree → Multi-timeframe confirmation.
• Prominent POC (pp. 165–225): −5 when trading away → Magnet risk.
• Spike Acceptance (pp. 103–157): +10 aligned, −6 against → Carry-over conviction.
• Gap Context (pp. 70–92): +10 favorable (outside + OD/OTD + ON aligned + acceptance), −8 unfavorable → Out-of-balance logic.
• dPOC (pp. 45–92): +6 migration aligned/persistent, −6 stability against idea → Value shift vs balance.
• HVN/LVN (pp. 45–92): +5 traversal supports, −5 gravity fights → Node structure.
• Peer Gap Close (pp. 70–92): +4 supportive, −4 contradictory → Cross-index signal.

Use: Sum components → Strong (≥70), Moderate (50–69), Weak (<50). Adjust size and aggressiveness to match confidence.
