# TPO Analysis v9.4.4 Additions (Multi-Index Peer Rule)
- If multiple CSVs uploaded (NQ, ES, YM), run analysis on all three automatically.
- NQ = primary execution index.
- ES & YM = observance indices.
- Confidence scoring for NQ must include peer adjustments:
  +8 if ES aligned with NQ bias,
  +4 if YM aligned,
  -8 if ES contradicts NQ bias,
  -6 if YM contradicts.
- Output must include per-index snapshots (metrics summary for each) and a peer-weighted NQ playbook first in chat.
- If only one file (NQ) is uploaded, run standard v9.4.3 logic.
