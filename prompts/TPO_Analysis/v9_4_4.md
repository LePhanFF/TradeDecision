# TPO Analysis v9.4.4 (FULL) - Dalton + Nuances, Educational Playbooks Embedded

Purpose: **Superset** of v9.3 -> v9.4.3. Nothing dropped. Includes 15-minute dPOC tracking, HVN/LVN arrays, peer gap-close, full morph set, and an educational playbook library (embedded).  
**New in v9.4.4:** Adds multi-index peer rule (NQ = primary execution, ES/YM = observance indices, peer confidence adjustments).

## 0) Inputs & Validation
- Inputs: 5m OHLCV RTH (and optional ON); prior-day refs (H/L, TPO VAH/POC/VAL; Volume VA/POC/VAL if available); tick size; ADR(20); optional peer symbols for cross-index gap checks.
- Validation: continuity, no duplicates, timezone aligned, outlier guard, prior refs present, ON integrity; peers optional (graceful skip).
- If any critical reference is missing, degrade gracefully (lower confidence, skip only the dependent metric).
- **If multiple CSVs uploaded (NQ, ES, YM), run analysis on all three automatically. NQ = primary execution index; ES & YM = observance indices.**

## 1) Metrics (complete superset)
1. Open context
   - Opening location vs prior value/range; Opening Type (OD/OTD/ORR/OA).
2. Gap Module
   - Gap_Type: Outside_Prior_Range, Into_Prior_Range, Within_Prior_Value.
   - Gap_Size_Ticks, Gap_Size_%ADR, Gap_Fill_% (0-100), Time_to_First_50pct_Fill, Was_Fill_Completed.
3. Overnight Inventory
   - ON_Inventory_State: Too_Long/Too_Short/Balanced; ON-correction risk flag.
4. IB/RE
   - IB hi/lo/size; RE direction; Acceptance tiers: Provisional (2x15m + developing TPOs) vs Confirmed (>=1x30m + elongation/value drift).
5. Value Areas (TPO + Volume if available)
   - Today's VAH/POC/VAL; Volume VAH/POC/VAL; Value vs Yesterday: Higher/Lower/Overlapping/Inside/Outside.
6. Profile features
   - Day Types: Trend (Up/Down), Double-Distribution, Normal, Normal-Variation, Neutral, Neutral-Extreme, Non-Trend/Balance (D).
   - Shapes: P (short covering), b (long liquidation), D (balance). Morph states: P->B, b->B, D->P, D->b, Normal->Trend, Neutral->Extreme, Trend->DD.
   - Excess & Poor High/Low; Spike & Spike Base; One-timeframing; Prominent POC; Revisit Magnets (single prints, b/p fat loops).
7. Developing POC (dPOC) - 15-minute tracking
   - Rebuild TPO counts up to each 15-minute checkpoint since RTH open.
   - Fields: dpoc_current, dpoc_start, dpoc_path_15m (array of [time, price]), dpoc_migration_ticks, dpoc_migration_speed_ticks_per_hr, dpoc_stability_ratio_last4, dpoc_jump (None/Up/Down).
8. HVN/LVN (node scaffolding)
   - Build a histogram (TPO and/or volume). Identify local maxima (HVN) and minima (LVN) with prominence threshold and spacing.
   - Report **multiple** nodes above and below current price: hvns_above, hvns_below, lvns_above, lvns_below (each: price, prominence, method=TPO/Volume, distance_in_ticks).
9. RTH Gap Close
   - rth_gap_dir (Up/Down/None), rth_gap_size_ticks, rth_gap_close_time, rth_gap_close_elapsed_min; peer_gap_closed list and earliest peer time if peers provided.
10. Balance Box
   - balance_box_top, balance_box_bottom, inside_balance flag for LAB/LBF and D-day logic.
11. 15m overlay
   - Early acceptance/rejection at IB extremes; provisional -> confirmed upgrade path.
12. Cross-index evidence
   - Track peer gap-close status to adjust confidence and caution notes.

## 2) Dynamic Confidence Scoring (0-100; verbose sub-scores)
- Opening type: OD 30, OTD 22, ORR 18, OA 8 (cap 30).
- RE status: Confirmed +20; Provisional +12; Failure -10.
- Value vs Yesterday: Outside/Higher/Lower +12; Overlaps +5/-5; Inside 0.
- Volume alignment: +10 aligned; -5 misaligned.
- Day-type clarity: Trend +12; Double-Distribution +8; Normal/Normal-Variation/Neutral/Neutral-Extreme +6; Balance +4.
- One-timeframing: +8 if active.
- 30m vs 15m confluence: +8 agree; -8 disagree.
- Prominent POC risk: -5 if trading away from it.
- Spike acceptance: +10 with bias; -6 against.
- Gap context: +10 (Outside_Prior_Range + OD/OTD + aligned ON + acceptance); -8 if value-inside + OA + early rejection.
- dPOC: +6 if migration aligns and persists; -6 if high stability contradicts breakout idea.
- HVN/LVN: +5 if LVN->HVN traversal supports idea; -5 if HVN gravity fights idea or LVN rejection contradicts.
- Peer gap-close: +4 if peers supportive; -4 if peers contradict.
- **Peer adjustments (multi-index, v9.4.4): +8 if ES aligned with NQ bias, +4 if YM aligned, -8 if ES contradicts NQ bias, -6 if YM contradicts.**
- Print sub-scores and a one-line rationale.

## 3) Playbook Selection & Evidence Echo
- Use the embedded library below. A session can match multiple plays; select all compatible and **rank** by confidence.
- For each chosen playbook, echo in chat:
  - Day Type, Bias, Confidence (score)
  - Triggers, Ideal Entry, Exit Targets, Invalidation
  - **Educational notes**: context, why (Dalton page ranges), metrics_used, bias_confidence, sizing, conviction
  - **Supporting Evidence**: list specific metrics that fired (e.g., "Gap_Type=Outside_Prior_Range", "RE=Confirmed Up", "dPOC migrating up 12 ticks/hr", "LVN rejection at 5212.50", "Nearest HVN 5236.00 (22 ticks)").

## 4) Output (Verbose JSON + Human Table)
- JSON includes: validation, metrics, day_type, bias, confidence (bucket, score, components), **playbooks** (with educational object), and supporting_evidence array.
- Human table includes: Opening Type, IB/RE, Value vs Yesterday, Shape, Morph, dPOC state, HVN/LVN context, Prominent POC, Spike/Base, Confidence, Day Type, Bias.

## 6) Notes and Cautions
- Acceptance is time-at-price; treat 15m as provisional until 30m confirms.
- Do not fade one-timeframing until it breaks.
- Prominent POC can magnetize price; reduce size when trading away.
- HVN/LVN: auctions move fast through LVNs and linger at HVNs; use this for targets and invalidations.
- If 30m and 15m disagree, 30m sets narrative; 15m times entries.
