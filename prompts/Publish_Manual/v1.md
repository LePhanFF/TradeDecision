PROLOGUE (Chapter 0)
Open with: "In 2025, trading without AI is like trading without a computer in 1970."
Explain why price alone is only the receipt of the last trade, and why auction + volume reveals acceptance/rejection.
Present AI as a "consistency engine" (validation, journaling, tilt detection, risk reminders, live voice nudges).
Keep it motivational and honest about trader flaws (fatigue, dopamine, tunnel vision) and how AI helps without being an oracle.
Include a short quiz that tests only the Prologue’s ideas.

GLOBAL STYLE & EXPLAINABILITY
- Audience: 8th–10th grade reading level. Friendly, coach-like voice. Short sentences. No jargon without an inline definition.
- No black boxes: always "show your work". For example:
  * How VAH/VAL/POC are computed (using OHLC midpoints) with a tiny numeric example.
  * How the VAH/VAL Strength Score is assembled (base LVN/HVN + confluence factors) and print the parts.
  * How the Unified Score (0–100) is built (list categories and points).
  * Acceptance vs rejection examples (e.g., "2 closes beyond edge + POC up" vs "tail + single prints + no POC shift").
- Parenthetical citations for claims (e.g., "Dalton, Markets in Profile, 2007") and a References appendix. Do not use footnote boxes.
- Make it engaging: hooks, analogies, mini-stories, and tiny intraday scenarios. Use "coach" callouts: "Remember", "Common trap", "Watch for".
- Always tie back to the chapter’s unifying theme before moving on.

DIAGRAM STANDARD (MANDATORY)
- Price on the vertical axis; time across horizontally.
- Mark VAH (top), VAL (bottom), and POC (mid) on the vertical axis.
- Teaching-grade diagrams only (not placeholders); ASCII-safe labels.

EXAMPLES (RANGES)
- Use realistic illustrative ranges:
  * ES around 5180–5230
  * NQ around 18100–18350
- Label examples "illustrative" (not signals).

QUIZ RULE
- 5 questions per chapter with answers and reasoning.
- Spiral design: each quiz may test content from the current and prior chapters only (never from future chapters).

CHAPTER STRUCTURE (EVERY CHAPTER)
1) Hook
2) Why it matters
3) Core idea explained in prose (define terms inline)
4) Worked example(s) with small numbers and ES/NQ illustrations
5) Pitfalls to avoid
6) TL;DR (1–3 short lines)
7) Quiz (5 questions, each with answer + short reasoning)

CHAPTER 1 (AUCTION THEORY FOUNDATION) CONTENTS (MANDATORY)
Explain clearly with diagrams and examples:
- Value Area, VAH/VAL, POC (what they mean and why they matter)
- HVN vs LVN (acceptance vs rejection; LVN edge stronger, HVN shoulder softer)
- Acceptance vs Rejection (2+ closes/rotations + POC migration vs tails/single prints + no POC shift)
- Initial Balance (IB) and Range Extension
- One-timeframing (up or down)
- Single Prints and Poor High/Low (repair concept)
- Spikes and Gaps (spike base next-day test; gap hold/close logic)
- Rolling POC and Prominent vs Weak POC
- TPO vs Volume (time-at-price vs contracts-at-price), and TPO construction (letters, IB, singles)
- Success vs Failure auctions (what “works” or “fails” looks like in evidence)
- Bridge into Context and Day Types
- Include price-vertical/time-horizontal diagram(s); ES/NQ examples.

CHAPTER 2 (CONTEXT FRAMEWORK)
- Build the Context Box using Chapter 1 vocabulary:
  * Higher-timeframe references (weekly/monthly VAH/VAL/POC; bracket highs/lows)
  * Value migration (up/down/overlapping across 1–3 sessions)
  * Market environment (Balance/Transition/Imbalance) and confidence (low/med/high)
  * Gaps and session extremes (ONH/ONL, London high/low) and whether gap held/closed
  * Inventory condition (too long/too short)
- Revisit TPO briefly (IB acceptance; singles) and include tiny worked examples.
- Show how context prevents contradictory reads later.

CHAPTER 3 (DAY TYPES I: D, P, b)
- Rich narration for D, P, b:
  * IB evolution (what confirms acceptance vs rejection)
  * Morph logic (D→P/b/B; P→B/Trend Up; b→B/Trend Down)
  * LVN/HVN considerations at edges
  * POC migration (confirmations/warnings)
  * TPO distribution shape vs volume profile
  * Success vs Failure auctions (what each looks like)
  * AM vs PM plays (edge fades vs go-with pullbacks; late-day breakout risk)
- Include price-vertical/time-horizontal diagrams for each day type; ES/NQ examples.

CHAPTER 4 (DAY TYPES II: B-DAY, NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL EXTREME)
- B-Day: two distributions with LVN seam pivot; how the second bulge forms; use the seam to fade or go-with.
- Neutral vs Neutral Extreme: both IB sides tested; close mid for Neutral; close near a side for Neutral Extreme with late POC drift there.

CHAPTER 5 (DAY TYPES III: TREND, NON-TREND, RANGE)
- Trend: acceptance beyond IB + one-timeframing + POC migration; avoid fading true trends.
- Non-Trend: narrow IB, POC mid, mean-revert small size.
- Range: multi-day bracket; fade edges; watch for sustained break with value migration.

CHAPTER 6 (LATE-DAY BREAKOUT & MULTI-DISTRIBUTION)
- Late-day breakout: after ~14:00, acceptance with closes and POC migration; go-with pullbacks; invalidation = back inside value before close.
- Multi-distribution: treat each distribution as a mini-profile; seams as pivots; trade edge-to-POC per distribution.

CHAPTER 7 (POC TRACKING & CONFIRMATION)
- Rolling POC (15m and 1h) vs prior POC: confirms tone; warns of reversals; integrate with acceptance tests.

CHAPTER 8 (CARRY-FORWARD FRAMEWORK)
- What to carry: spike base, poor highs/lows, single prints, naked VAH/VAL/POC, LVN seams, weekly bracket edges.
- How to use: plan AM/PM tests against these references.

CHAPTER 9 (VALIDATION LAYER)
- Print anchors (09:30 open, prior 16:00 close), gap status/time, VAH/VAL/POC, HVN/LVN 68% ranges, rolling POC timestamps, acceptance evidence.
- State timezone/session policy (RTH only) and cross-validate.

CHAPTER 10 (MARKET INTERNALS & ICT; SUPPORTING MODULES)
- Internals as confirmation/divergence (ADD, TICK, UVOL–DVOL, VIX) and keep them secondary to profile math.
- ICT overlays (SMT divergence, FVG, OB, PDH/PDL) only as confluence at structural edges.

CHAPTER 11 (QUICK TRADE CARDS)
- 4-line cards: Bias, Entry, Targets, Invalidation. Speak the card out loud. No trade without a card.

CHAPTER 12 (WORKFLOW GUIDE)
- Light mode intraday; Full mode EOD; Pretend-time backtests (no forward bars); integration notes for exports and journaling.

CHAPTER 13 (EXAMPLES & DIAGRAMS)
- Teaching-grade pictures for D, P, b, B-seam, Neutral Extreme; consistent labels; short captions and mini-scenarios.

CHAPTER 14 (CHAPTER QUIZZES)
- Practice sets that reinforce the chapters covered so far; no future content; reasoning included.

CHAPTER 15 (APPENDICES)
- Quiz Bank (20–50 scenario MCQs grouped by topic); Study Path (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced); Glossary (plain language; cross-refs); References list.

PERSISTENCY / NO REGRESSION
- Revisions are additive. Never remove the following from any chapter once added: the narrative, worked examples, diagram(s), TL;DR, and the 5-question quiz.
- Keep ASCII-safe text throughout to avoid PDF glyph issues.
- Diagrams must always use the price-vertical/time-horizontal standard and mark VAH/VAL/POC on the axis.
- Quizzes must spiral only from current and prior chapters.
- Use ES and NQ ranges that look realistic for illustrations.

OUTPUT
- A single PDF that includes cover, TOC, Chapters 0–15, clickable chapter bookmarks, headers/footers, diagrams, and a References appendix.
